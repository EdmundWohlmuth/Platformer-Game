The Platformer Game						
By: Edmund Wohlmuth
using Unity 2020.3.14f1

The Platformer Game is a third person platforming-collectathon game made for my 1st Year Game Development Iterative Desgin class. It is the first game I have developed using the Unity engine and was developed over the course of the first semester in two week "sprints".

The main goal behind The Platformer Game was to create a fun player controller that had simple but enjoyable movement and while it is no Mario I am quite happy with how it turned out.

Triple Jumping:
On consecutive jumps the player's jump height increases culmnating in the third and heighest jump, afterwards returning to the initial jump height, if the player put enough time between jumps the height of the jumps will remain at the initial jump height.


Wall Jumping:
When the player moves into a wall while airbone and press the jump key the player charcter will preform a wall jump sending the character away from the wall and allowing them to reach higher places, in conjunction with the triple jump the options for player movement creates some fun combinations.


There is a total of six stars in the game spanning two levels which can be reaches via the portals in the Hub world.
